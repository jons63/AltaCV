\cvsection{Experience}

\cvevent{Development Engineer}{QRTECH AB}{September 2019 -- Ongoing}{MÃ¶lndal, Sweden}
\begin{itemize}
\item Worked on an embedded AUTOSAR project for Volvo cars SPA2 platform. The project is 
built on NXPs S32K14x platform for which I helped develop a bootloader and application using Vectors 
DaVinci platform.
\item Developing internal processes for CI/CD and release management. 
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{About me}

I am someone who easily integrates into new environments and get along with anyone. 
It is always fun to meet and work with new people who I can learn from and share my knowledge with.
Many of my current colleagues have become friends that I spend time with outside of work. I look
forward to finding more friends at Cybercom!
\smallskip

If I were to describe myself, it would be as a hobbyist. I constantly have ongoing projects and many more in
the backlog. You can find my latest project on github where I am working on a Python application to 
discover and explore more advanced topics (closures, metaclass, decorators to name some that I have discovered).
Fortunately for me work and hobbies go hand in hand. What I learn at work can later be applied in a project 
of my own while my free time is spent developing new skills that I have use for at work. Last summer 
I set up my own CI chain at home with Jenkins and Gitea, as we used these at work, to later work on 
automating releases at work.
\smallskip

Cybercom is offering an interesting position where C++ and Linux based development are two thing I want to
learn more about. Working in an environment with other professionals will greatly accelerate this learning 
process. I hope to not only contribute to the services Cybercom provides but also Cybercom as a company.
